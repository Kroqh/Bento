Game Engine prototype

## This is a learn experience for me 
Most inspiration have been from sources like TheCherno's GameEngine series where he develops one called "Hazel" which is focussing on 2D where he teahces the basics of Game Engine architecture and is a very useful and easy to process source. Can highly recommend.

After I am done with his series I plan to deviate to making 3D capabilities using the Vulkan graphics API and just mess around and see what I can make.
